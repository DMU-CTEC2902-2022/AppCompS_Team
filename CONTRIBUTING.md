# **Reporting Bugs** #

**Before Submitting a Bug Report:**

A good bug report shouldn’t leave others needing to chase you up for more information. Therefore, we ask you to investigate carefully, 
collect information and describe the issue in detail in your report. Please complete the following steps in advance to help us fix any potential bug as fast as possible.

* Make sure that you are using the latest release (Releases can be found here : [Releases](https://github.com/DMU-CTEC2902-2022/AppCompS_Team/releases))
* Determine if your bug is really a bug and not an error on your side e.g. using incompatible environment components/versions (Make sure that you have read the [project's documentation](https://github.com/DMU-CTEC2902-2022/AppCompS_Team/wiki/Coursework-Brief#project-brief) to get a general idea. 
(Note: Development was mostly done on [Visual Studio 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/preview/), [VS Code v.1.65](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_65)). 
* Make sure if the issue/bug isn't reported. (Check here : [Issues](https://github.com/DMU-CTEC2902-2022/AppCompS_Team/issues))
* Also make sure to search the internet (including [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/)) to see if users outside of the GitHub community have discussed the issue.
* Collect information about the bug (To fill the [issue template](https://github.com/DMU-CTEC2902-2022/AppCompS_Team/issues/new/choose))
